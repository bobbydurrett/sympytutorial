Made lprint.py to output latex as matplotlib plot.

Installed MiKTeX on Windows 10 laptop.

Had an Oracle Linux source intall of Python 3.8.1.

As root did this to get LaTex installed:

yum install texlive

yum install texlive*

second yum command was needed to get dvipng

Linux console c7.py unicode and LaTex works
but not in Putty or Windows console without
LaTex installed.
