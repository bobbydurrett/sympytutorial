Made myprint.py to output latex as matplotlib plot.
Also ascii pretty print with extra line.

Installed MiKTeX on Windows 10 laptop.

Had an Oracle Linux source intall of Python 3.8.1.

As root did this to get LaTex installed:

yum install texlive

yum install texlive*

second yum command was needed to get dvipng

Linux console c7.py unicode and LaTex works
but not in Putty or Windows console without
LaTex installed.

Got rid of lprint using matplotlib

Might rewrite to call latex command line utilities directly
and generate a pdf
